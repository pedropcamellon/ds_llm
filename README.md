# DontStarve-LLM: LLM-Powered Don't Starve Autonomous Agent

**Watch Wilson play Don't Starve autonomously using an LLM!**

An LLM-driven agent integrated with the "Artificial Wilson" Don't Starve mod. The agent perceives game state, reasons about decisions, and controls Wilson entirely on its own.
